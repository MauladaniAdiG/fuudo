## :gem: Design Insipiration

I've been inspired from here:

- [Summer](https://dribbble.com/shots/6389042-Light-Meals-Design)

And I'm sorry if I can't even mention it, but my inspiration comes from the designer in [dribbble.com](https://dribbble.com/) about food app design

## :pick: Tools for Create Apps

I created this application with the help of a very special tools such as:

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) : A great framework for build beautiful and natively apps from a single codebase
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) : Also known as code editor tools for developing apps with many helpful plugins
